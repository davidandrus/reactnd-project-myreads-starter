MyReads: A book Tracking App:

This is the first project for Udacity's React Developer Nanodegree. It is a simple React App where one can search for books and add them to their bookshelves based on whether you have read them, are currently reading them, or would like to read them.

This repo was initially forked from the starter template found at: https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter

NOTE: if you choose to view the app, you should know that the search terms are limited to those found in SEARCH_TERMS.md, so if you type anything other than that into the search, you will not get results.

4) A browser window should open pointing to localhost:3000 with the app running
