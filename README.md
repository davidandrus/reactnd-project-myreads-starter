# MyReads: A Book Tracking App

This is the first project for Udacity's React Developer Nanodegree. It is a simple React app where one can search for books and add them to their bookshelves based on whether they have read them, are currently reading them, or would like to read them.

This repo was initially forked from the starter template found at: https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter

**NOTE:** if you choose to view the app, you should know that the search terms are limited to those found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](https://github.com/davidandrus/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/blob/master/SEARCH_TERMS.md), so if you type anything other than those into the search, you will not get results.

To view the app from the browser visit: https://davidandrus.github.io/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/

## Running the app locally:

To run the app locally you will need to have `node`  installed and either `yarn` or `npm` installed globally.

1) ```git clone``` this repo
2) ```cd reactnd-project-myreads-starter``` or whatever you named the folder when cloning
3) ```npm start``` or ```yarn start```
4) A browser window should open to localhost:3000 with the app running
